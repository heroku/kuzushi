  Kuzushi ( ku ZU she ) - a technique used by martial artists to control of an
  opponent by keeping them slightly off balance.

The 'kuzushi' gem is a companion to the 'judo' gem.  Judo handles
AWS/instance/volume management of a server based on its specification.
Kuzushi handles the management from inside the server by installing packages,
setting up drives and users, writing config files, etc
